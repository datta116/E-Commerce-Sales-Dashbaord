## 🧐 Project Overview
This project examines a complex supply chain dataset (referencing `Data.csv`) to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and operational bottlenecks. 

**Key Objectives:**
* Analyze **Sales vs. Profit** across different global markets (LATAM, USCA, Europe, etc.).
* Identify the most profitable **Product Categories** (e.g., Camping & Hiking, Water Sports).
* Evaluate **Shipping Performance** by comparing order dates vs. shipment regions.
* Monitor **Profit Margins** per order to identify loss-making transactions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Tableau Desktop (.twbx):** For advanced data visualization and dashboarding.
* **Excel / CSV:** Data source containing order details, customer segments, and geographic data.

* **Customer Segmentation:** Analysis of Home Office, Corporate, and Consumer segments.
* **Geographic Reach:** Sales tracking across cities like Caguas (PR), Los Angeles (CA), and international markets.
